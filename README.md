# DREPAL-PATHOEXTRACT

DREPAL-PATHOEXTRACT is an NGS analysis toolkit.

DREPAL-PATHOEXTRACT was developed to aid in the analysis of next generation sequencing data. Users can do the following with this APP:

* Import sequences  
* Remove adapters, low quality bases/positions, and perform read-level QC 
* Align paired-end sequencing reads to the human reference genome.
* Extract unmapped/unaligned reads.
* Visualize the part of each element in the sequence 


Dependencies: 

The DREPAL-PATHOEXTRACT APP contains a pipeline requires the following dependencies:

* Fastp
* sickle
* Fastqc 
* BWA 
* Samtools

DREPAL-PATHOEXTRACT was built with SnakeMake in Python  ...
