                bioinformatics, to perform the main steps of NGS data preprocessing (in the form of raw paired end FASTQ

            <p class="lead">This module allows us to load, delete and finally check the quality of the samples in our
                workspace.
                Indeed, modern high-throughput sequencers can generate tens of millions of sequences in a
                single run. After loading the samples, PathoExtract always allows you to perform some simple quality
                checks to ensure that the raw data is good before analyzing the sequences to draw biological
                conclusions.</p>

                </span></h2>
            <p class="lead">The most important part of pathoExtract is the digital double subtraction.
                Indeed, the digital double subtraction uses is a set of utilities to interact with and post-process read
                alignments of short DNA sequences in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) and CRAM.
                These files are output by short read aligners like BWA. Digital double subtraction supports complex
                tasks such as alignment visualization as well as sorting, indexing, data extraction and format
                conversion.</p>
